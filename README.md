# Resources
Big ups to the following for helping me out on this assignment:

* Stephen Greig from [tangled in design](http://tangledindesign.com/how-to-create-a-contact-form-using-html5-css3-and-php/) for providing coding guidance and inspiration for my form.
* The good folks at [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseover) for their assistance with the mouseover event. 
* The [W3C](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_style.asp) for their awesome list of style object properties.
* Nick! He was a tremendous help and should probably get a raise.
* [Chip and Joanna Gaines](https://magnoliamarket.com/fixer-upper/season-4/) for staying grounded and adorable. #Shiplap and #DemoDay forever, y'all!

# Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

# Comments
This was the worst assignment I ever had, but also probably one of the ones that I learned the most from.

Something went horribly, horribly wrong when I tried to fix an older comment. I don't know what I did and I never want to speak of it again.
